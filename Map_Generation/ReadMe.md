# Movement Data Analyzer

This project is designed to fetch, process, and visualize movement data based on input parameters such as time range, location, and identifiers. The program fetches data from a specified API, processes it to identify movements, and generates visualizations using Plotly.

## Overview

The Movement Data Analyzer allows you to:
1. Fetch movement data from an API.
2. Process the data to calculate movement statistics such as speed, distance, and duration.
3. Generate interactive maps using Plotly and Folium that visualize movement points and routes.
4. Control the verbosity of the output to obtain more or less detailed logs of the data processing and visualization.

## Features

- **Data Fetching**: Retrieve movement data based on date ranges, identifiers (`qtok`), and other filters.
- **Data Processing**: Calculate distances, speeds, and other movement metrics using geospatial data.
- **Map Visualization**: Generate interactive maps with movement paths and detailed tooltips.
- **Customizable Verbosity**: Optionally view detailed processing steps and logs through command-line verbosity levels.

## Requirements

The following libraries are required to run the program:
- Python 3.x
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `argparse`
- `plotly`

Any additional dependencies can be installed from the `requirements.txt` file if provided.

## Configuration

The program uses a TOML file for configuration. Ensure the configuration file (`config.toml`) is properly set up before running the program.

## Classes and Methods

### DataFetcher

The `DataFetcher` class retrieves movement data from an external API based on the following parameters:
- `qtok`: The unique identifier for the dataset.
- `pie`: Indicates whether the data refers to the left or right foot.
- `start_date`: The beginning of the analysis period.
- `end_date`: The end of the analysis period.

### DataProcessor

Once the data is fetched, the `DataProcessor` class processes the raw data:
- **Haversine Formula**: Used to calculate distances between two points on the Earthâ€™s surface.
- **Movement Calculation**: Identifies unique movements and calculates metrics such as distance, speed, and movement duration.

## Map Generation

### Plotly Map

The `generate_plotly_map` method generates an interactive map with movement lines and hover tooltips showing detailed information like average speed and duration.

## Main Script (mainExtGPS)

The main function:
- Parses command-line arguments.
- Retrieves data from a configurable API.
- Processes it into a structured format.
- Generates an interactive movement map using Plotly.

The script is versatile, with configurable options for verbosity, date range, output level, and movement segmentation.

## Sphinx Documentation

The folder contains two `.rst` files (`code_documentation.rst` and `index.rst`) that allow for documentation generation using Sphinx.

To generate HTML documentation:
```bash
make html
```
To clean existing HTML documentation:
```bash
make clean
```
## Usage

### From Spyder IDE
```python
runfile('path/mainExtGPS.py', wdir='C:/Users/marbo/Documents', args='-f 2024-06-16 -u 2024-06-17 -v 2 -q MGM-202406-79 -p Right')
### From Command Prompt
```python
mainExtGPS.py -f 2024-06-16 -u 2024-06-17 -v 2 -q MGM-202406-79 -p Right
